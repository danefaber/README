# README
The Voting_Application project is a Python-based voting application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using PyQt6. The application enables users to cast votes for one of two candidates, ensuring secure and efficient data handling. Each user is identified by a unique user ID, and their vote is recorded in real-time.

Key Features:

User-Friendly GUI: Users can select a candidate using radio buttons and submit their choice with a button click.

Vote Recording: Votes are securely saved to a CSV file, including the user's ID and choice.

Real-Time Feedback: A confirmation message is displayed after successful vote submission.

Live Vote Tally: The bottom of the GUI shows a live tally of votes for both candidates, updated dynamically.
